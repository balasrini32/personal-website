abstract: This work provides the first unifying theoretical framework for node
  (positional) embeddings and structural graph representations, bridging methods
  like matrix factorization and graph neural networks. Using invariant theory,
  we show that the relationship between structural representations and node
  embeddings is analogous to that of a distribution and its samples. We prove
  that all tasks that can be performed by node embeddings can also be performed
  by structural representations and vice-versa. We also show that the concept of
  transductive and inductive learning is unrelated to node embeddings and graph
  representations, clearing another source of confusion in the literature.
  Finally, we introduce new practical guidelines to generating and using node
  embeddings, which fixes significant shortcomings of standard operating
  procedures used today.
