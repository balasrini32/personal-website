abstract: "We consider a simple and overarching representation for
  permutation-invariant functions of sequences (or multiset functions). Our
  approach, which we call Janossy pooling, expresses a permutation-invariant
  function as the average of a permutation-sensitive function applied to all
  reordering's of the input sequence. This allows us to leverage the rich and
  mature literature on permutation-sensitive functions to construct novel and
  flexible permutation-invariant functions. If carried out naively, Janossy
  pooling can be computationally prohibitive. To allow computational
  tractability, we consider three kinds of approximations: canonical orderings
  of sequences, functions with k-order interactions, and stochastic optimization
  algorithms with random permutations. Our framework unifies a variety of
  existing work in the literature, and suggests possible modeling and
  algorithmic extensions. We explore a few in our experiments, which demonstrate
  improved performance over current state-of-the-art methods."
