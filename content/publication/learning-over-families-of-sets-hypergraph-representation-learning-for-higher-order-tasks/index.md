abstract: Graph representation learning has made major strides over the past
  decade. However, in many relational domains, the input data are not suited for
  simple graph representations as the relationships between entities go beyond
  pairwise interactions. In such cases, the relationships in the data are better
  represented as hyperedges (set of entities) of a non-uniform hypergraph. While
  there have been works on principled methods for learning representations of
  nodes of a hypergraph, these approaches are limited in their applicability to
  tasks on non-uniform hypergraphs (hyperedges with different cardinalities). In
  this work, we exploit the incidence structure to develop a hypergraph neural
  network to learn provably expressive representations of variable sized
  hyperedges which preserve local-isomorphism in the line graph of the
  hypergraph, while also being invariant to permutations of its constituent
  vertices. Specifically, for a given vertex set, we propose frameworks for (1)
  hyperedge classification and (2) variable sized expansion of partially
  observed hyperedges which captures the higher order interactions among
  vertices and hyperedges. We evaluate performance on multiple real-world
  hypergraph datasets and demonstrate consistent, significant improvement in
  accuracy, over state-of-the-art models.
