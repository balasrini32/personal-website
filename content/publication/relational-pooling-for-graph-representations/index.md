abstract: This work generalizes graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond those based
  on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm, graph Laplacians, and diffusions. Our
  approach, denoted Relational Pooling (RP), draws from the theory of finite
  partial exchangeability to provide a framework with maximal representation
  power for graphs. RP can work with existing graph representation models and,
  somewhat counterintuitively, can make them even more powerful than the
  original WL isomorphism test. Additionally, RP allows architectures like
  Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks to be used in a
  theoretically sound approach for graph classification. We demonstrate improved
  performance of RP-based graph representations over state-of-the-art methods on
  a number of tasks.
